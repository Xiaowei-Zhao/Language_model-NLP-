# Language_model-NLP-

In this assignment I am exploring a language model with different orders and smoothing
techniques. I start with a Python script that helps build the models and implement one of
the smoothing techniques. I run this model and report the results and then
compare those to when I add a new smoothing technique. My intrinsic evaluation measure
for the model is¡®perplexity¡¯, I use a language identification problem for extrinsic
evaluation.

The smoothing techniques include Add-One smoothing and Katz back off smoothing

The last part is a quantitative error analysis
